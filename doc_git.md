## How to understand the `gpg failed to sign the data` problem

[sourse](https://gist.github.com/paolocarrasco/18ca8fe6e63490ae1be23e84a7039374)

Follow the below url to setup signed commit https://help.github.com/en/articles/telling-git-about-your-signing-key

if still getting gpg failed to sign the data fatal: failed to write commit object

this is not issue with git ,this is with GPG follow below steps

1. ```gpg --version```

2. ```echo "test" | gpg --clearsign```

if it is showing:
```
gpg: signing failed: Inappropriate ioctl for device
gpg: [stdin]: clear-sign failed: Inappropriate ioctl for device
```

3. then use ```export GPG_TTY=$(tty)```

4. then try again ```echo "test" | gpg --clearsign``` in which PGP signature is.

Output:
```
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA512

test
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----

```
5. ```git config -l | grep gpg```

Output:
```
commit.gpgsign=true
gpg.program=gpg
tag.gpgsign=true
```

6. apply ```git commit -S -m "initial commit ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€"```

7. or ```git config --global commit.gpgsign true```
